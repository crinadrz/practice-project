Putting into practice what I am learning from the udemy course " The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to mastery". For now, I am playing around with just html and css and after that I'll add to the page JS and frameworks! :) Making my own page in the process, trying to tackle different problems that may happen! 


Right now, I am mostly playing with HTML and CSS in order to make sure that I understood well most of the concepts. 13/09
